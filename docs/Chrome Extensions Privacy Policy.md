### **Simple Audio Capturer â€“ Privacy Policy**

**1. Introduction**  
Simple Audio Capturer ("we", "our", or "the extension") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle any information or data when you use our Chrome Extension.

**2. Information Collection and Use**  
- **Audio Data:**  
  This extension captures audio from the active Chrome browser tab. All captured audio data is processed entirely locally on your device and automatically downloaded as a file (WebM or WAV).  
  **We do not transmit or store any of this captured audio data on external servers.**

- **Personal Information:**  
  We do not collect, transmit, or store any personally identifiable information (PII) or user data from your usage of this extension.

- **Website Content (audio):**  
  Since the extension captures audio directly from websites you visit, it can include audio content (sounds, voices, music, video soundtracks) from the websites. Such audio content is used solely for local storage on your device and is never shared with us or third parties.

**3. Data Storage**  
All recorded data remains on your local device. We do not provide cloud storage or syncing services. Users are fully responsible for managing their locally downloaded files.

**4. Third-party Services**  
We do not use any third-party analytics, tracking tools, or data collection services.

**5. Security**  
All audio processing occurs locally, ensuring no data leaves your computer.

**6. Changes to This Privacy Policy**  
We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. Any changes will be reflected here with an updated effective date.
